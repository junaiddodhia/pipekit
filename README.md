# GitLab Integration

---

# **Overview**

The GitLab Integration project expanded the tool's capabilities beyond GitHub to include GitLab, responding to the demands of enterprise customers. One of our largest clients played a pivotal role in driving the expansion. This integration allowed for repository management, webhook events, and authentication, supporting our strategic move to serve more customers.

# **Project Highlights**

- Enabled users to connect GitLab accounts.
- Provided repository access, event management, and secure webhook subscriptions for GitLab.
- Improved the architecture for supporting multiple Git providers, paving the way for future integrations.

# **Problem Statement**

Initially, the product only supported GitHub integration, assuming it would be the most widely used platform for customers. However, significant demand arose from clients who used GitLab, making it crucial to expand integration support and enable broader adoption.

# **Solution Overview**

The integration involved enabling GitLab users to connect their accounts, access repositories, and manage workflows through webhook events, similar to GitHub. The backend was refactored to ensure that supporting multiple git providers was efficient, and the user interface was updated to maintain simplicity across providers.
